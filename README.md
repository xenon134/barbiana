A simple website to synchronize video playback on connected devices.

Ever wanted to watch a movie or TV show with friends online? You can put up with the horrible quality of Video Calling services, or you can use this website to synchronize Play, Pause, Seek, etc. between devices.

Other features include: YouTube Integration (not fully implemented yet) and playback rate change.
