about taking something

That's where we're starting?

You know your cars.

01:11.209 --> 01:12.576
I'm an enthusiast.

01:12.644 --> 01:14.711
And I've been waiting
for the Tesla for months.

01:14.779 --> 01:16.880
Okay.

Laurence.

01:23.687 --> 01:25.955
Knock yourself out.

01:26.022 --> 01:27.255
So why'd you let him have it?

01:27.323 --> 01:28.823
Because it never hurts
to have a man

01:28.891 --> 01:31.224
who runs a $2 billion
hedge fund owe you one.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.892
But if you're
just gonna give it to him,

01:32.960 --> 01:34.527
why bother to compete first?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.695
Because if I didn't beat him,

01:35.763 --> 01:37.264
he wouldn't feel
he owed me one.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.032
I'm suddenly
feeling old school.

Shut up.
Listen.

02:24.745 --> 02:25.912
You see these cars?

02:25.980 --> 02:27.380
Yeah. They're awesome.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.515
They suck.

They're nothing
compared to this.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.819
Whoa.

02:31.886 --> 02:34.221
The engine in this car
is made by McKernon Motors,

02:34.289 --> 02:37.123
the industry standard
in Formula One.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.159
In fact, they've won
more championships

02:39.227 --> 02:40.827
than any other engine
on the planet.

How do you know all this?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.130
Avery McKernon
was the first client

02:44.197 --> 02:45.431
I ever brought into the firm.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.633
- Was?
- He died three months ago.

02:47.701 --> 02:48.800
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry--

02:48.868 --> 02:49.968
Not the point.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.903
McKernon's engines
and his company

02:51.971 --> 02:54.539
have something in common--
They win, like me.

02:54.606 --> 02:57.408
And because I win, I've been
promoted to senior partner,

02:57.476 --> 02:59.244
which means you'll be handling
all their paperwork.

02:59.311 --> 03:00.545
Oh, so you brought me here

03:00.613 --> 03:01.980
to give me an appreciation
for the product.

03:02.047 --> 03:03.582
No, I brought you here
to meet Robert Stensland,

03:03.650 --> 03:04.850
the new CEO.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.518
He'll want to put
your name with a face.

03:06.586 --> 03:07.486
How do you know?

03:07.554 --> 03:09.088
Because Robert's a tightwad,

03:09.155 --> 03:10.289
and we don't bill you out
for nothing.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.557
Wait a minute.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.858
Is this conversation
right now billable?

03:12.926 --> 03:13.992
You bet your ass it is.

03:14.060 --> 03:18.029
Yes. Up top. Come on.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.164
What? We're making
all this money.

03:19.232 --> 03:20.299
We can't celebrate it?

03:20.366 --> 03:23.368
Not in poor taste.

03:23.436 --> 03:26.872
Dominic. Mike, I'd like
you to meet Dominic Barone,

03:26.939 --> 03:29.374
the man responsible
for the design and production

03:29.442 --> 03:30.708
of this engine.

03:30.776 --> 03:32.443
This is my new associate,
Mike Ross.

03:32.511 --> 03:33.845
He's just a kid.

03:33.912 --> 03:35.212
Are you trying to steal his soul
before he hits puberty?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.680
Okay, obviously...

03:36.748 --> 03:38.416
You're still upset
about our labor negotiations.

03:38.483 --> 03:39.884
My-- My workers
took a big hit.

03:39.952 --> 03:41.586
And McKernon took a bigger one.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.456
Both of which poised the company
to be strong for years.

03:44.524 --> 03:45.857
I was always
straight with you about that.

03:45.925 --> 03:47.825
Sophisticated words
for a guy who screwed us.

03:47.893 --> 03:48.760
Look, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

03:48.827 --> 03:50.094
but you have to admit,

03:50.162 --> 03:54.532
I did have the courtesy
to do it from the front.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.701
Wow. Yeah,
he really appreciates

03:56.769 --> 03:58.036
what you've done
for the company.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.471
Robert Stensland,

03:59.538 --> 04:02.441
I'd like you to meet
your new associate, Mike Ross.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.476
We're not paying him
what we pay you.

04:04.544 --> 04:07.513
Nor should you, but I assure
you he's highly effective.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.715
Well, I'll believe it
when I see it.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.717
I had him read
your corporate lease last week.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.552
Ask him anything.

04:13.620 --> 04:17.156
That's a 300-page document.

04:17.224 --> 04:20.559
Okay, what are the terms?

04:20.627 --> 04:22.428
Okay, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.063
The named lessee

04:24.130 --> 04:26.465
was the parent company,
Glendon Enterprises.

04:26.533 --> 04:30.135
35,000 square feet
at 19 west 57th.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.536
$80 a foot.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.806
Expires in six months
with an option to extend.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.308
Exercisable in 30 days.

04:36.376 --> 04:39.478
- Who signed the lease?
- You did.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.847
- What's my middle name?
- The letter "L."

04:41.914 --> 04:44.483
What happens in the event
the company no longer exists?

04:44.551 --> 04:45.751
That wasn't in the lease.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.085
How can you be sure?

04:47.153 --> 04:49.021
Because the lease
I read wasn't 300 pages.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.523
It was 364.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.526
And I can tell you what's on
any one of those pages,

04:52.593 --> 04:53.860
but I can't tell you that.

04:53.928 --> 04:55.495
That's how I can be sure.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.896
Excellent.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.832
You can get him started
on the new deal right away.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.533
- New deal?
- Yeah.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.870
I have found a buyer
willing to spend $200 million

05:03.938 --> 05:05.405
for the ground underneath
the flagship factory.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.040
Where are you moving
manufacturing?

05:07.107 --> 05:08.408
Well, that's the beauty of it.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.977
The real asset of
McKernon Motors is the name.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.079
We move overseas,
we save ourselves a bundle.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.847
Up front payout
while retaining the name

05:14.915 --> 05:15.948
and maintaining
cash flow over time.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.218
That's genius.
Exactly.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.453
All right,
we'll take care of everything.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.722
- Okay.
- All right.

05:21.789 --> 05:25.226
- Thanks.
- Really?

05:25.294 --> 05:27.128
Jesus.
I knew he was cheap.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.230
I didn't realize
he was an idiot.

05:28.297 --> 05:29.698
What are you talking about?

05:29.765 --> 05:31.400
The asset's not the name.
It's the quality.

05:31.468 --> 05:33.469
He moves overseas,
it's gonna kill the goose

05:33.536 --> 05:34.536
that laid
the goddamn golden engine.

05:34.604 --> 05:35.771
Wait a minute.

05:35.839 --> 05:36.872
I thought you didn't get

05:36.940 --> 05:38.674
emotionally attached
to the client.

05:38.742 --> 05:40.075
I'm emotionally attached to me.

05:40.143 --> 05:42.410
Look, I made a bet
that this company would grow

05:42.478 --> 05:44.212
and my billables
would grow with it.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.480
We're holding a pair of aces,

05:45.548 --> 05:47.215
and this asshole's
trying to fold.

05:47.283 --> 05:48.883
So?
What are you gonna do?

05:48.951 --> 05:50.084
I'm not gonna do anything.

05:50.152 --> 05:51.119
You're gonna
go through those bylaws,

05:51.187 --> 05:52.254
and you're gonna find me a way

05:52.321 --> 05:53.622
to get rid of Robert Stensland.

05:53.690 --> 05:54.890
No, no, no, no.
I have to go see my grandmother.

05:54.958 --> 05:56.358
Uh-uh.

Yeah, neither

from thinking about it.

07:47.710 --> 07:50.545
Harvey.
Promise me you won't be cocky.

07:50.613 --> 07:52.047
I understand
what's at stake here.

07:52.114 --> 07:53.148
I'll be perfectly humble.

07:53.216 --> 07:54.483
Great.
You ready?

07:54.551 --> 07:57.286
You kidding?
I was born for this.

07:57.354 --> 08:00.390
7:45.
Nice of you to show up.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.125
Uh, yeah, I was up
till 5:00 in the morning.

08:02.193 --> 08:04.128
I'm kidding.
But Louis Litt wants to see you,

08:04.196 --> 08:05.296
and I don't kid about that.

08:05.363 --> 08:06.597
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

08:06.664 --> 08:08.031
Louis doesn't let me in
on his game plan,

08:08.099 --> 08:09.566
but I kind of
prefer it that way.

08:09.634 --> 08:11.701
Okay, um, can you tell him
that I have to see Harvey first?

08:11.769 --> 08:13.102
Your call.

08:13.170 --> 08:15.271
But, uh, if you're gonna be
sleeping in your suits,

08:15.338 --> 08:17.072
you may want to keep
a fresh one in the office.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.107
Is it that bad?

08:18.174 --> 08:20.142
It's worse.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.810
Come on.

08:21.878 --> 08:23.445
I'd just like to say
this is an honor,

08:23.512 --> 08:24.679
I take it seriously,

08:24.746 --> 08:26.447
and I intend
to make you all proud.

08:26.515 --> 08:27.982
Except you, Fred.

08:28.050 --> 08:31.787
I gave up on making
you proud in '99.

08:31.855 --> 08:35.691
Okay. There is one more
order of business.

08:35.759 --> 08:38.294
He's not here.

08:42.267 --> 08:45.903
No.

08:45.971 --> 08:47.271
Where is he?

08:47.339 --> 08:48.706
He's at his senior partner
initiation.

08:48.773 --> 08:50.641
Oh. That's great.
But let me ask you something.

08:50.709 --> 08:53.110
What's the difference
between a senior partner

08:53.178 --> 08:55.145
and...other partners?

08:55.213 --> 08:56.780
Isn't that something
you should have been studying

08:56.848 --> 08:59.582
when you were pretending
to go to Harvard?

08:59.650 --> 09:02.485
Okay. Senior partners,
they buy into the firm.

09:02.552 --> 09:03.652
They share in the profits,

09:03.720 --> 09:04.853
but they also
have to put up equity.

09:04.921 --> 09:07.689
So how much does it cost
to buy in?

09:07.757 --> 09:11.192
$1/2 million...
right now?

09:11.260 --> 09:13.427
Harvey, you knew
what the buy-in was.

09:13.495 --> 09:15.496
You knew today was initiation.

09:15.564 --> 09:17.165
How could you not
have the money?

09:17.232 --> 09:21.502
I didn't think
it was due today.

09:21.569 --> 09:22.803
It's not due today, is it?

09:22.871 --> 09:24.939
No. It's not.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.579
Every man in this room
fell for exactly the same thing.

09:30.646 --> 09:31.646
Does that include you?

09:31.714 --> 09:33.315
No.
No, it doesn't.

09:33.383 --> 09:35.584
Thank you, gentlemen.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.765
Peanuts, gluten, strawberries.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.567
What is this?
A shopping list?

09:50.634 --> 09:52.168
No, it's just a list of foods
that I'm allergic to,

09:52.236 --> 09:54.003
so when you select the venue,

09:54.071 --> 09:55.972
these foods
are not to be on the menu.

09:56.039 --> 09:57.273
A venue for what?

09:57.341 --> 09:59.641
No one told you?

09:59.709 --> 10:01.042
- No one told me.
- Oh, drats.

10:01.110 --> 10:03.611
Well, a long-standing
Pearson Hardman tradition

10:03.679 --> 10:04.846
is the rookie dinner,

10:04.914 --> 10:07.015
which means you, the...

10:07.083 --> 10:08.416
- Rookie. Yes.
- That's right.

10:08.484 --> 10:12.588
Are to host a dinner
for your fellow associates.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.523
Well, come on.
Don't look so blue.

10:14.591 --> 10:15.857
Oh, it's okay.
It's really easy.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.993
All you have to do
is just find a unique location

10:18.061 --> 10:19.895
and then coordinate
with 50 other associates.

10:19.962 --> 10:22.497
It's really simple.
No pressure.

10:22.564 --> 10:23.731
And you're allergic to chicken?

10:23.799 --> 10:26.734
No, I just don't like it.

10:26.802 --> 10:29.470
Oh, by the way,
what was so important

10:29.538 --> 10:31.439
that you had to see Harvey
before you came to see me?

10:31.506 --> 10:32.840
Louis,
Harvey doesn't really--

10:32.908 --> 10:35.242
Can we-- Can we-- Can we--
Can we just-- Shut up.

10:35.310 --> 10:36.577
Okay.

10:36.645 --> 10:38.512
Let me just get something
straight, okay?

10:38.580 --> 10:39.613
When I ask you a question,

10:39.681 --> 10:42.783
I just expect an answer.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.186
Uh...

10:46.253 --> 10:47.421
McKernon Motors.

10:47.488 --> 10:49.924
I was working
on the due diligence.

10:49.992 --> 10:55.664
And why would that require you
to look at the bylaws?

10:55.732 --> 10:57.433
State law requires
a summary be prepared

10:57.501 --> 10:58.768
in the event of a sale.

10:58.836 --> 11:00.637
Privately held corporations
are exempted.

11:00.705 --> 11:02.739
Not if the sale
exceeds 150 million.

11:02.807 --> 11:05.376
According to who?

11:08.747 --> 11:11.315
The state's website.

11:11.383 --> 11:13.718
I like to be thorough.

11:15.321 --> 11:17.755
Well, put it there, buddy.

11:17.823 --> 11:19.224
Are you fricking serious?

11:23.596 --> 11:26.031
I understand Stensland
is throwing a large amount

11:26.099 --> 11:28.834
of legal work our way with the
McKernon Motors factory sale.

11:28.902 --> 11:29.869
How'd you know that?

11:29.937 --> 11:30.970
I hear things.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.105
You taking care of him?

11:32.172 --> 11:33.373
I am.

11:33.441 --> 11:35.642
By the way, for when it is due.

11:35.710 --> 11:36.977
What's this?

11:37.044 --> 11:39.714
It's a cashier's check
for $500,000.

11:41.416 --> 11:43.351
You had this the whole time.

11:43.419 --> 11:46.587
I've had the money since I
set my sights on senior partner.

11:54.028 --> 11:55.628
Nice of you to finally make it.

11:55.696 --> 11:57.563
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

11:57.631 --> 11:58.897
Because you're
supposed to be here

11:58.965 --> 11:59.932
when you're supposed
to be here.

11:59.999 --> 12:01.400
Doesn't seem to apply to you.

12:01.467 --> 12:03.335
I'm not the topic
of this conversation.

12:03.402 --> 12:05.904
Now what'd you find me
on McKernon Motors?

12:05.972 --> 12:08.307
The board can't vote
for at least 24 hours

12:08.375 --> 12:10.109
after the CEO presents a deal

12:10.176 --> 12:11.477
involving the sale
of company land.

12:11.545 --> 12:13.613
But Stensland already
presented it to the board.

12:13.681 --> 12:16.150
Right, but Stensland isn't CEO.

12:16.217 --> 12:19.319
I wrote those bylaws myself.
He's CEO.

12:19.387 --> 12:23.358
Hmm.
Page 238, clause 137

12:23.425 --> 12:25.794
states if the CEO dies,

12:25.862 --> 12:27.762
an interim CEO
will be appointed

12:27.830 --> 12:29.364
until the board
convenes an election vote,

12:29.431 --> 12:31.599
which can't be called
till the next fiscal quarter,

12:31.667 --> 12:33.567
in this case next Thursday.

12:33.635 --> 12:36.303
So they can't vote him in
until Thursday?

12:36.371 --> 12:37.604
Thursday.

12:37.672 --> 12:39.406
Okay.

12:39.474 --> 12:41.174
Well, prepare the due diligence

12:41.242 --> 12:42.509
for me to take to Stensland,

12:42.576 --> 12:43.976
but I don't want anything
ready to sign.

12:44.044 --> 12:45.511
- Where are you going?
- Out.

12:45.579 --> 12:47.279
I have until Thursday
to find a new CEO.

12:47.347 --> 12:49.048
- Huh.
- What?

12:49.116 --> 12:51.918
Oh, nothing.
Uh, you know, just six hours,

12:51.986 --> 12:55.121
1,500 pages, and I, uh,

12:55.189 --> 12:56.724
I found your mistake.

12:56.791 --> 12:59.226
Yeah, you found
the one mistake I made

12:59.294 --> 13:02.063
while drafting those bylaws
a dozen years ago

13:02.131 --> 13:03.731
when I was two years
younger than you.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.133
A mistake, by the way,

13:05.201 --> 13:07.169
that's gonna help me
get rid of Stensland.

13:07.237 --> 13:09.071
Mistake.

13:26.516 --> 13:28.583
Excuse me, Mr. Specter?

13:28.650 --> 13:30.418
I was wondering if you might
need a hand sometime

13:30.486 --> 13:31.452
with one of your matters.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.486
Uh, any one.

13:32.554 --> 13:33.921
Well, Allen--

13:33.989 --> 13:35.189
It's Aaron.

13:35.257 --> 13:38.726
I think that says it all,
don't you?

13:38.793 --> 13:40.994
What are you doing?

13:41.062 --> 13:42.829
Uh, I'm looking
for a restaurant.

13:42.897 --> 13:44.431
Where did you go
for your rookie dinner?

13:44.499 --> 13:46.066
I came into the league
a sophomore.

13:46.134 --> 13:47.300
You better not be
prioritizing that

13:47.368 --> 13:48.534
over McKernon Motors.

13:48.602 --> 13:49.969
I still need something
to stall Stensland.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.738
It's right here.

13:52.806 --> 13:54.307
What are you
so irritated about?

13:54.374 --> 13:56.742
I spent a day
with a top headhunter I know

13:56.810 --> 13:59.112
who couldn't produce one
legitimate CEO candidate

13:59.180 --> 14:00.247
by Thursday.

14:00.314 --> 14:01.348
What about
that Dominic Barone guy

14:01.416 --> 14:02.683
who runs production?

14:02.750 --> 14:04.285
You said he was responsible
for the engines,

14:04.353 --> 14:05.853
and he clearly cares
about the workers.

14:05.921 --> 14:07.655
No, he's not the guy.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.358
Oh, you're scared
you can't convince him

14:09.425 --> 14:11.093
because he hates you.
I get it.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.361
Nice try.

14:12.428 --> 14:13.696
You know you can't
host your dinner there.

14:13.763 --> 14:16.131
That's a Wachtell, Lipton,
Klein restaurant.

14:16.199 --> 14:18.433
Okay. Fine.

14:18.501 --> 14:20.302
What about this place?

14:20.370 --> 14:22.471
Yeah, that'd be great
if it was 2004.

14:22.538 --> 14:23.605
Oh, my God.

14:23.673 --> 14:27.743
Why does any of this matter?
God.

14:27.811 --> 14:30.478
You see that guy
over there by the fax?

14:30.546 --> 14:35.049
Take a good look.

14:35.117 --> 14:36.551
He's never gonna make partner.

14:36.618 --> 14:38.386
Okay. Let me guess.

14:38.454 --> 14:40.689
Because he threw
a lousy rookie dinner?

14:40.757 --> 14:42.724
No, because he doesn't get it.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.360
Get what?

14:44.427 --> 14:47.530
He doesn't get that doing
good work isn't the whole job.

14:47.598 --> 14:49.098
Part of getting it

14:49.166 --> 14:50.900
is that things like the dinner
actually matter,

14:50.968 --> 14:53.003
even when
you don't think they do.

14:53.070 --> 14:54.438
Look,
you were giving me shit

14:54.505 --> 14:55.706
this morning because
I come and go when I want to.

14:55.773 --> 14:57.007
You know why I can do that?

14:57.075 --> 14:59.609
Because when I got here,
I dominated.

14:59.677 --> 15:01.844
They thought I worked
100 hours a day.

15:01.912 --> 15:04.180
Now, no matter
what time I get in,

15:04.247 --> 15:07.483
nobody questions my ability
to get the job done.

15:07.551 --> 15:08.985
Get it through your head.

15:09.053 --> 15:10.853
First impressions last.

15:10.921 --> 15:12.555
You start
behind the eight ball,

15:12.622 --> 15:14.457
you'll never get in front.

15:25.937 --> 15:27.737
- Hey, you busy?
- It's 7:00.

15:27.805 --> 15:29.873
I'm not here
'cause I like the view.

15:29.941 --> 15:31.308
And don't misunderstand me.

15:31.376 --> 15:33.176
When I say "The View,"
I'm referring to your face.

15:33.244 --> 15:34.878
That's funny,
because I'm hideous.

15:34.946 --> 15:36.913
- What's up?
- You're a foodie, right?

15:36.981 --> 15:38.014
Why do you say that?

15:38.082 --> 15:39.350
Because you're the only person

15:39.418 --> 15:40.818
I've ever seen order
a shrimp, red pepper,

15:40.886 --> 15:41.919
and goat cheese pizza.

15:41.987 --> 15:43.555
Well, right,
but without the pepper,

15:43.623 --> 15:45.357
what connects the goat cheese
and the shrimp?

15:45.425 --> 15:46.892
I'm a foodie.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.695
Okay, so I need your help
finding a restaurant

15:48.762 --> 15:49.796
for the rookie dinner.

15:49.864 --> 15:51.098
Well, that's unfortunate,

15:51.165 --> 15:52.633
but I'm swamped,
and I don't have time

15:52.700 --> 15:53.834
to teach you about cuisine.

15:53.902 --> 15:55.202
Well, no,
don't make me remind you

15:55.270 --> 15:56.971
that you owe me one.
How's that?

15:57.038 --> 15:58.872
You told Louis I was working
on Harvey's case before his.

15:58.940 --> 16:00.408
Because you told me to.

16:00.475 --> 16:02.043
Well, now I'm telling you
to help me with my dinner.

16:02.110 --> 16:03.144
Mm.

16:03.211 --> 16:05.212
- You-- Okay.
- Good luck with that.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.515
Not gonna help me
with my dinner.

16:07.583 --> 16:10.584
Now I'm talking to myself.

16:13.155 --> 16:14.454
Yeah, grammy.

16:14.522 --> 16:15.923
No, I told you I was coming.

16:15.990 --> 16:21.895
I'm-- I'm on my way, okay?
Yeah.

16:21.963 --> 16:25.364
Um, 15 minutes.

16:25.432 --> 16:27.666
Okay. Bye.
Hey, what are you--

16:27.734 --> 16:30.069
Okay, what was that for?

16:30.136 --> 16:31.336
If you cared about me,

16:31.404 --> 16:32.704
you would have told me
what Trevor was up to

16:32.772 --> 16:33.672
a long time ago.

16:33.739 --> 16:35.073
I was trying to protect you.

16:35.141 --> 16:36.841
How is hiding the fact

16:36.909 --> 16:39.244
that my boyfriend
is selling weed protecting me?

16:39.312 --> 16:40.913
You want to know the truth?

16:40.980 --> 16:43.916
Your boyfriend also happens
to be my best friend, all right?

16:43.984 --> 16:44.951
I didn't feel
like ratting him out.

16:45.018 --> 16:46.519
If you were really his friend,

16:46.587 --> 16:48.355
you wouldn't just stand by
and let him throw his life away.

16:48.422 --> 16:50.023
Let him? Let--

16:50.091 --> 16:52.293
I've never let Trevor
do anything. Have you met him?

16:52.360 --> 16:54.862
Trevor listens to you,
and he needs you right now.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.097
Oh, my God.

16:56.165 --> 16:57.899
He is throwing his life away,

16:57.966 --> 17:00.501
and you ditched us.

17:00.569 --> 17:03.705
Both.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.140
Like we didn't mean
anything to you.

17:10.646 --> 17:13.281
I'm...I'm late.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.370
Louis.
What are you doing here?

17:36.438 --> 17:38.606
Hi.
Uh, Stensland called.

17:38.674 --> 17:41.209
And apparently the diligence
wasn't proceeding apace.

17:41.276 --> 17:42.410
He called you?

17:42.478 --> 17:43.244
Yeah, he called me,
I called him,

17:43.312 --> 17:44.413
what's the difference?

17:44.480 --> 17:45.313
The paperwork
was taking too long,

17:45.381 --> 17:46.748
and I got it done.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.918
I suggest you stay
the hell away from my client.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.488
Harvey.
Glad you could make it.

17:51.555 --> 17:52.622
We were about
to sign the papers.

17:52.690 --> 17:53.490
I got word back at the office.

17:53.557 --> 17:54.658
I just came to see how Louis

17:54.725 --> 17:57.260
was getting around the bylaws.

17:57.328 --> 17:59.062
I...don't know.

17:59.129 --> 18:01.498
Ah...

18:01.566 --> 18:02.532
I'm at somewhat of a loss.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.934
Robert, I'm sorry.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.769
This is what was holding up
your due diligence.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.604
Technically,
you're still interim CEO

18:07.671 --> 18:09.606
until the board
votes you in on Thursday.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.874
If protocol isn't followed,

18:10.941 --> 18:12.542
it leaves you with huge
litigation exposure.

18:12.610 --> 18:13.877
That's right.

18:13.945 --> 18:17.080
Well, I imagine
we should hold off, then.

18:17.148 --> 18:19.082
Please don't blame Louis.
It's my fault.

18:19.150 --> 18:21.952
We usually have senior partners
oversee transactions like this

18:22.020 --> 18:23.853
because junior partners,
they tend to miss things.

18:23.921 --> 18:24.855
See you Thursday?

18:24.922 --> 18:26.657
One second.

18:26.724 --> 18:27.991
Uh, just so you know,

18:28.059 --> 18:29.860
you were a junior partner
until recently.

18:29.928 --> 18:31.795
There's a reason
I'm not anymore.

18:31.863 --> 18:33.697
Okay. Take it easy.

18:33.765 --> 18:36.333
So what if you took a trip
to Russia with another man?

18:36.401 --> 18:38.468
I mean, that was before
you met grandpa Jimmy, right?

18:38.536 --> 18:40.703
He didn't care
it was before I met him.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.205
Never shut up about it.

18:42.273 --> 18:44.107
So what was
this other guy's name?

18:44.175 --> 18:45.910
Gregory mind your own business.

18:45.977 --> 18:47.811
Ooh.

18:47.879 --> 18:49.846
So, Michael, this has been fun.

18:49.914 --> 18:51.715
Now why don't you stop
beating around the bush

18:51.782 --> 18:56.921
and tell me what's going on.

18:56.988 --> 18:59.223
Trevor.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.925
It's Trevor.
It's always Trevor.

19:00.993 --> 19:03.128
He's gotten himself
into some really bad...

19:03.195 --> 19:06.431
stuff, and I think he needs
my help to get out of it,

19:06.499 --> 19:08.767
but I've been under
so much pressure,

19:08.835 --> 19:10.836
and I know you've always told
me to be there for people...

19:10.903 --> 19:12.437
No, no, listen to me.

19:12.505 --> 19:14.506
- Screw Trevor.
- What?

19:14.574 --> 19:15.674
You're moving forward,

19:15.742 --> 19:17.342
and he'll do whatever he can

19:17.410 --> 19:18.810
to keep you where you are.

19:18.878 --> 19:19.811
Yeah, but...

19:19.879 --> 19:20.879
But no buts.

19:20.947 --> 19:22.414
That kid is an anchor.

19:22.482 --> 19:26.251
You need to cut him loose.

19:26.318 --> 19:29.453
- Whoa.
- You owe me 50 bucks.

19:39.797 --> 19:42.566
What's going on
with Robert Stensland?

19:42.633 --> 19:44.000
What did Louis tell you?

19:44.068 --> 19:46.470
You're not dealing with Louis.
You're dealing with me.

19:46.538 --> 19:47.704
What are you hiding?

19:47.772 --> 19:48.905
Nothing.
I looked through the bylaws

19:48.973 --> 19:50.540
and precluded
potential litigation.

19:50.608 --> 19:53.476
You looked at the bylaws
for a tactical reason,

19:53.544 --> 19:54.577
and I want to know what it is.

20:00.317 --> 20:01.584
I want him out.

20:01.651 --> 20:03.852
That is not your call.
You are an attorney.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.454
This is the internal business
of McKernon Motors.

20:06.522 --> 20:08.223
Look, McKernon had a plan,

20:08.291 --> 20:09.858
and I didn't spend
a decade shaping it

20:09.925 --> 20:11.192
to let this fool throw it away.

20:11.260 --> 20:12.493
McKernon is dead.

20:12.561 --> 20:13.761
So what?
Doesn't mean the plan's no good.

20:13.829 --> 20:15.629
You fail, we'll get fired.

20:15.697 --> 20:16.964
He moves overseas,

20:17.032 --> 20:18.733
our billables ll be gone
in five years, anyway.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.402
Better five years than nothing.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.004
You know what?
That's Stensland's attitude,

20:22.071 --> 20:24.340
and it's a losing one.

20:24.407 --> 20:27.677
Harvey, I don't think
you have any business

20:27.745 --> 20:29.646
telling that man
how to run his company,

20:29.714 --> 20:31.515
but I know you don't
have any business

20:31.583 --> 20:33.083
telling me how to run mine.

20:33.151 --> 20:34.719
You are a senior partner.

20:34.786 --> 20:36.821
You are not
a gunslinger anymore.

20:36.889 --> 20:39.690
Back off Stensland
and close the deal.

20:54.021 --> 20:55.322
I need you to prepare

20:55.390 --> 20:57.391
the draft CEO candidate speech
for Thursday.

20:57.458 --> 20:58.726
Well, I thought you
were supposed to back off.

20:58.793 --> 21:00.060
Yeah, I'm supposed to do
a lot of things.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.963
I'll call you with the plan
on my way back.

21:02.031 --> 21:03.198
From where?

21:03.265 --> 21:04.633
From convincing
the man who hates me

21:04.700 --> 21:06.701
to do what I say.
Oh, right.

21:06.769 --> 21:09.170
You mean the guy I suggested
you go to in the first place.

21:09.238 --> 21:10.505
Do you remember that whole

21:10.573 --> 21:11.506
getting it thing
I was talking to you about?

21:11.574 --> 21:13.041
What, I can't even gloat?

21:13.109 --> 21:15.609
Gloating's fine.
You just have to not suck at it.

21:15.677 --> 21:18.646
Okay.
Thank you. So much.

21:18.714 --> 21:20.181
That hurt.

21:25.954 --> 21:27.188
Hey, Ross.

21:27.256 --> 21:28.656
You left your search
for the rookie dinner

21:28.724 --> 21:29.657
on your computer.

21:29.725 --> 21:30.658
Why don't you just save time

21:30.726 --> 21:32.293
and take us to Friday's?

21:32.360 --> 21:33.694
Ooh, ooh, somebody's mad.

21:33.762 --> 21:35.796
Devon, looking at my computer

21:35.864 --> 21:37.797
is a violation of exactly seven

21:37.865 --> 21:39.432
hostile workplace
environment statutes.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.567
What are you gonna do?
Sue me?

21:41.635 --> 21:42.835
No.
No, no, no.

21:42.903 --> 21:44.203
I'm just gonna use it
as legal cover

21:44.271 --> 21:46.271
if I decide to kick your ass.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.182
Dominic.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.850
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.752
Our contract's good
for two more years.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.521
I need a word.
In private.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.756
Excuse me, Joe.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.524
Make it fast,
'cause this is a place

22:06.592 --> 22:07.826
where people actually
work for a living.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.561
Well, keep in mind
people are watching.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.496
Just try to keep
your expression neutral.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.697
You know, they don't teach

22:12.765 --> 22:13.932
deceptive tactics
where I come from.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.867
Then you're gonna learn
under fire.

22:14.935 --> 22:16.802
Stensland's shutting you down.

22:16.870 --> 22:18.204
What? Why?

22:18.272 --> 22:19.673
For money.

22:19.740 --> 22:22.309
He's got a buyer for the land
under the factory.

22:22.377 --> 22:24.011
Why are you coming to me?

22:24.079 --> 22:26.047
Because the only way
to stop him

22:26.115 --> 22:27.815
is for you
to challenge him as CEO.

22:27.883 --> 22:29.016
What?
Are you crazy?

22:29.084 --> 22:30.284
You've got a management title.

22:30.352 --> 22:31.619
That I choose
not to identify with.

22:31.687 --> 22:32.686
You run the factory.

22:32.754 --> 22:33.988
Which I never left,

22:34.055 --> 22:35.356
'cause I have no taste
for boardroom politics.

22:35.424 --> 22:36.958
You've been here since day one.

22:37.026 --> 22:38.459
You know the product
inside out.

22:38.527 --> 22:39.727
These workers,
they respect you.

22:39.795 --> 22:41.629
Pew, that's a lot of smoke.

22:41.697 --> 22:43.298
How many people
did you go to before me?

22:43.366 --> 22:44.933
- Seven.
- Right.

22:45.001 --> 22:47.069
I never said
you were my prom queen.

22:47.136 --> 22:48.503
Look, I want to win, okay?

22:48.571 --> 22:50.005
I went to those other people

22:50.072 --> 22:51.673
because they were better
suited to get past the board,

22:51.741 --> 22:53.475
not better suited for the job.

22:53.543 --> 22:55.644
Those are the facts
whether you like it or not.

22:55.712 --> 22:56.678
And why should I trust you?

22:56.746 --> 22:58.013
Because if you don't,

22:58.081 --> 23:00.249
there aren't any jobs
left to negotiate over.

23:00.316 --> 23:02.351
You and the factory,
you're finished.

23:16.833 --> 23:18.000
What are you working on?

23:18.068 --> 23:20.369
Um, nothing.
Just some stuff for Harvey. Why?

23:20.437 --> 23:21.871
Wrap it up.
Louis Litt wants to see you.

23:21.939 --> 23:23.873
This time
he doesn't want to wait.

23:35.887 --> 23:37.222
Furthermore,

23:37.290 --> 23:39.591
I feel that with
the proper strategic

23:39.659 --> 23:42.528
and synergistic alliances
moving forward--

23:42.595 --> 23:44.564
I have to actually believe
what you're saying.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.533
They're just platitudes
that don't mean anything.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.034
Yes, they do.
Synergistic alliances

23:48.102 --> 23:49.802
mean you form relationships

23:49.870 --> 23:51.437
to get the cost down
and your product out.

23:51.505 --> 23:53.072
It's never gonna work.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.307
Well, it better goddamn work.

23:54.374 --> 23:55.842
My ass is on the line.
What about my ass?

23:55.909 --> 23:57.477
If it wasn't attached
to your thick head,

23:57.545 --> 23:59.379
maybe we wouldn't be
having this problem.

23:59.446 --> 24:00.713
I'm sorry I'm not
as well practiced

24:00.781 --> 24:03.182
at corporate double speak
as you'd like,

24:03.250 --> 24:05.918
but I've been busting my ass
on this for two hours.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.653
So if you're not happy
with my progress,

24:07.720 --> 24:11.924
then why don't you
get the hell out?

24:11.991 --> 24:16.061
He doesn't leave
without getting it.

24:19.198 --> 24:21.333
Son of a bitch.

24:24.203 --> 24:26.237
You're not gonna pick it up?

24:26.305 --> 24:27.872
Why should I?
Never gonna get it.

24:27.940 --> 24:31.376
You're right.

24:31.443 --> 24:36.115
Hey, can I ask you something?

24:36.182 --> 24:40.486
What's your engine design
philosophy?

24:40.554 --> 24:42.822
Perfectly balanced
power and durability.

24:42.890 --> 24:46.859
Okay. Why don't you favor
power like Bronson does?

24:46.927 --> 24:48.861
Because drivers are limited
to eight engines a season,

24:48.929 --> 24:50.162
and Bronson's don't last.

24:50.230 --> 24:51.397
Well, so you would
stack your engines

24:51.464 --> 24:52.831
up against Bronson's, then?

24:52.899 --> 24:54.699
Uh, I have stacked
my engines up against Bronson

24:54.767 --> 24:56.167
and everyone else's
in the world,

24:56.235 --> 24:57.935
and mine win.
Why?

24:58.003 --> 24:59.370
Because I make sure

24:59.437 --> 25:01.572
they're designed better
than anyone else's in the world

25:01.639 --> 25:03.173
from the day
that they're conceived

25:03.241 --> 25:04.307
to the day they're born.

25:04.375 --> 25:05.609
And that's why people buy them.

25:05.676 --> 25:07.110
Goddamn right.

25:07.178 --> 25:09.212
And that's the speech
you're gonna give.

25:21.892 --> 25:23.626
Good lawyer, bad lawyer, baby.

25:23.694 --> 25:25.596
Worked like a charm.

25:25.663 --> 25:28.198
Come on.
You know you want it.

25:28.266 --> 25:30.034
There it is.
Told you.

25:30.102 --> 25:31.168
Someone doesn't like you,

25:31.236 --> 25:32.503
you use it against them.

25:32.571 --> 25:33.772
Or, in this case, for them.

25:33.839 --> 25:35.740
<i>I didn't do this for Dominic.</i>

25:35.808 --> 25:37.175
I did it
to get rid of Stensland.

25:37.243 --> 25:40.279
Wow. Have you ever considered
writing for Hallmark?

25:40.347 --> 25:42.782
Many times. Yeah.

25:42.850 --> 25:45.652
Congrats.

25:45.719 --> 25:48.154
Looking good.

26:00.700 --> 26:01.600
Hey.

26:01.668 --> 26:02.801
I said don't be late.

26:02.869 --> 26:04.870
Late? I'm not late.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.739
When you host your dinner here,

26:06.806 --> 26:09.208
not being late means getting
here a half hour early.

26:09.275 --> 26:12.178
Aha. So what made you
change your mind?

26:12.245 --> 26:15.180
The food items are samples
to help you select your menu,

26:15.248 --> 26:19.485
so since I could never really
afford to eat here myself...

26:19.552 --> 26:21.053
Mm.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.288
Mm.

26:22.355 --> 26:24.022
Okay, start there.

26:24.090 --> 26:25.090
- Try that?
- Yes.

26:25.158 --> 26:26.057
It looks kind of funny.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.092
So does an egg roll.

26:27.159 --> 26:28.326
I don't accept that premise.

26:28.394 --> 26:30.195
You want my help or not?

26:37.735 --> 26:38.669
Ugh. What is that?

26:38.736 --> 26:39.870
Squid.

26:39.937 --> 26:43.739
I-- I think
it's still moving.

26:43.807 --> 26:47.709
That's what I'm talking about.

26:47.777 --> 26:49.078
Mm.

26:49.146 --> 26:50.313
I don't get it.

26:50.381 --> 26:52.248
How do you have no appreciation
for fine food?

26:52.316 --> 26:55.185
Mm. We didn't have a lot
of money growing up.

26:55.253 --> 26:56.787
I don't know.

26:56.855 --> 26:59.223
I guess I'm just comfortable
with what I'm comfortable with.

26:59.291 --> 27:01.159
That is the exact
opposite of me.

27:01.226 --> 27:03.495
I've-- I've always
loved new experiences.

27:03.562 --> 27:05.029
And your parents?

27:05.097 --> 27:06.565
They're loaded.

27:06.632 --> 27:10.202
Mm. So then what do you need
a free meal for?

27:10.269 --> 27:12.404
I want to live on what I make.

27:12.471 --> 27:13.938
Mm.

27:14.006 --> 27:16.307
- What?
- Nothing.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.242
I was just thinking about
Dominic for a second.

27:18.310 --> 27:21.445
And then I realized
this is the first time in weeks

27:21.512 --> 27:23.046
that I haven't been
thinking about work.

27:23.114 --> 27:24.948
That's what new
experiences do for you.

27:25.016 --> 27:29.085
Being a foodie doesn't mean
only liking fancy food.

27:29.152 --> 27:30.787
Means having
the courage to try it.

27:30.854 --> 27:32.955
And then you get to serve
what you like.

27:33.023 --> 27:34.690
Except strawberries, peanuts,

27:34.758 --> 27:35.892
gluten, and chicken.

27:35.959 --> 27:37.259
Okay, why not those things?

27:37.327 --> 27:38.961
Because Louis is an asshole.

27:39.028 --> 27:41.130
If you can't serve things
just 'cause Louis is an asshole,

27:41.198 --> 27:43.566
you're not gonna have
that many choices.

27:43.634 --> 27:44.567
Good point.

27:51.274 --> 27:55.177
So what really
made you change your mind?

27:55.245 --> 27:58.113
Pity.

27:58.181 --> 27:59.715
I'll take it.

28:10.494 --> 28:13.563
Driver, taketh me
to Williamsburg.

28:16.232 --> 28:17.233
It's Jenny.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.134
Trevor told me
you talked to him,

28:19.202 --> 28:20.636
and he's gonna stop.

28:20.704 --> 28:21.637
Thanks, Mike.

28:21.705 --> 28:22.805
Hold on.

28:22.872 --> 28:24.840
Change of destination.

28:27.645 --> 28:28.611
Trevor.

28:28.679 --> 28:30.913
What are you doing here?

28:30.981 --> 28:34.183
Can we talk for a minute?

28:34.251 --> 28:36.352
Yeah.

28:40.557 --> 28:43.692
I know you lied to Jenny
about us talking.

28:43.760 --> 28:44.860
You never should have told her

28:44.928 --> 28:46.329
I was dealing
in the first place.

28:46.397 --> 28:48.531
I never should have had
to hide it in the first place.

28:50.134 --> 28:53.737
Look, Trevor, you don't need
to be dealing for a living, man.

28:53.805 --> 28:55.505
You could make something
of yourself.

28:55.573 --> 28:56.706
Is that what
you came here to tell me?

28:56.774 --> 28:58.408
You've got real
software clients, man.

28:58.476 --> 28:59.476
Stick to them.

28:59.544 --> 29:01.712
Jeez.
You believe that crap?

29:01.779 --> 29:04.081
I don't have
any software clients.

29:04.148 --> 29:06.850
Jesus.
You're as naive as Jenny.

29:06.918 --> 29:08.352
Look...

29:08.419 --> 29:10.654
If you need some kind of
transition money or something--

29:10.722 --> 29:11.855
What? How?

29:11.923 --> 29:13.690
Does it matter?

29:13.758 --> 29:17.928
Look, what matters is that
you don't help me out, okay?

29:17.996 --> 29:18.929
I help you out.

29:18.997 --> 29:20.164
And I'm not interested

29:20.232 --> 29:22.400
in transitioning into anything.

29:22.468 --> 29:24.736
Okay.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.504
But the least you could do
is be honest with Jenny.

29:26.572 --> 29:27.806
That's what this is all about.

29:27.873 --> 29:29.107
- Yeah.
- You always liked her.

29:29.175 --> 29:32.410
I think she deserves
to know the truth.

29:32.478 --> 29:33.911
You always thought
you were better than me.

29:35.181 --> 29:36.915
Maybe that's because I am.

29:47.827 --> 29:51.865
Come on now.
All right?

30:00.475 --> 30:02.710
We're done.

30:02.778 --> 30:04.612
Don't let the door hit you--

30:27.414 --> 30:28.547
Call Dominic?

30:28.615 --> 30:30.215
He's waiting for us outside.

30:30.283 --> 30:31.550
He's got the speech down?

30:31.617 --> 30:33.018
Yeah, he's got it down.

30:33.085 --> 30:35.086
Better.
I'm taking a big risk on him.

30:35.154 --> 30:36.587
You're taking a risk on him?

30:36.655 --> 30:38.789
Look at him.

30:38.857 --> 30:40.257
He's scared out of his mind.

30:40.325 --> 30:41.626
He's leaving his comfort zone

30:41.693 --> 30:43.862
because you convinced him to.
So?

30:43.929 --> 30:46.565
So maybe some words
of encouragement.

30:46.632 --> 30:48.233
The best way to help Dominic

30:48.301 --> 30:50.069
is not to let him
second guess himself.

30:50.137 --> 30:52.739
The most important asset
an attorney has

30:52.806 --> 30:55.408
is his ability
to always be self-assured.

30:55.476 --> 30:58.045
Okay.
Here's what's gonna happen.

30:58.113 --> 30:59.747
It's standard for me
to prep the board

30:59.814 --> 31:00.915
on any voting procedure.

31:00.982 --> 31:02.450
When do I speak?

31:02.517 --> 31:05.219
When I tell you to.
Let's go.

31:09.090 --> 31:10.890
I suggested to Stensland
you be there

31:10.958 --> 31:12.759
to convince the board
the production won't be hurt

31:12.826 --> 31:13.926
by an overseas move.

31:13.994 --> 31:15.327
It helps your credibility

31:15.395 --> 31:16.695
that he brought you here,

31:16.763 --> 31:19.231
and it'll hurt his when
you challenge him for CEO.

31:23.236 --> 31:25.838
Look, it's natural
to be nervous, okay?

31:25.906 --> 31:27.507
Just remember,
you know your stuff.

31:27.574 --> 31:28.808
The board's never
loved Stensland,

31:28.876 --> 31:30.176
and I'm here to back you up.

31:30.244 --> 31:32.011
Okay.

31:40.221 --> 31:42.056
Robert.

31:42.123 --> 31:44.758
Harvey.

31:44.826 --> 31:45.726
You know, I have to admit,

31:45.794 --> 31:46.994
I almost didn't see it coming.

31:47.061 --> 31:48.428
Excuse me?

31:48.496 --> 31:49.796
It was the delay
in the due diligence.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.231
It just didn't smell right.

31:51.299 --> 31:52.832
So the only thing it could be

31:52.900 --> 31:56.235
was that you were going after
my CEO appointment.

31:56.303 --> 31:58.570
So since I'm still within my
rights to move a board meeting,

31:58.638 --> 31:59.705
I did.

31:59.772 --> 32:02.340
I was voted in today at noon.

32:02.408 --> 32:05.210
And tomorrow the board will
ratify the sale of the factory.

32:05.278 --> 32:09.515
And now I'm firing your firm.

32:09.583 --> 32:12.618
And I'm firing you.

32:12.686 --> 32:14.787
Try the croissant, gentlemen.

32:14.854 --> 32:16.989
Marmalade's fantastic.

32:27.001 --> 32:28.402
What are we gonna do?

32:28.470 --> 32:29.971
You're gonna go through
those bylaws again,

32:30.039 --> 32:31.239
and see if there isn't
another way

32:31.306 --> 32:32.507
we can stop this sale.

32:32.575 --> 32:33.508
I'm talking about Dominic.

32:33.576 --> 32:34.810
He just lost his job.

32:34.878 --> 32:36.845
He's a grown man.
He made a decision.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.481
Because you convinced him to.

32:38.548 --> 32:39.749
Based on your idea,

32:39.817 --> 32:41.518
which I recall
you pushed on me at the time.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.619
Because I thought
it would work at the time.

32:43.687 --> 32:44.720
Well, it didn't. What do you
want me to do about it?

32:44.788 --> 32:46.989
Help him.

32:47.057 --> 32:48.257
He's not dying.
He lost his job.

32:48.325 --> 32:49.659
He has to look for another one.

32:49.726 --> 32:50.994
Which, if he hadn't chosen

32:51.061 --> 32:52.061
to fight for his company
in the first place,

32:52.129 --> 32:53.163
would have happened anyway.

32:53.230 --> 32:54.731
Now, show me that you get it,

32:54.799 --> 32:56.299
go back through
those bylaws again,

32:56.367 --> 32:58.835
and see if you missed anything.
Okay?

33:01.840 --> 33:03.774
So this is what happens
when you promote the wrong guy

33:03.841 --> 33:05.208
to senior partner.

33:05.276 --> 33:06.610
If you hadn't gone
to Stensland behind my back,

33:06.677 --> 33:08.545
this wouldn't have happened.
You don't know that.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.180
And I'm a member of this firm
just as much of you.

33:10.248 --> 33:11.348
Oh, I think we both agree
that you're a member.

33:11.415 --> 33:13.550
For your information,
I didn't even--

33:13.618 --> 33:15.919
Louis.
Harvey, eye on the ball.

33:15.987 --> 33:18.855
The issue here is you tried
to torpedo a client--

33:18.923 --> 33:21.257
The client is McKernon Motors,
not Stensland.

33:21.325 --> 33:22.525
You didn't let me finish.

33:22.593 --> 33:24.961
Without my consent.

33:25.029 --> 33:27.697
That trumps
the "who's the client" part.

33:27.765 --> 33:30.667
Louis, go to Stensland,
repair the relationship.

33:30.734 --> 33:33.236
Say what you have to.
Call it a misunderstanding.

33:33.304 --> 33:36.539
Promise Harvey
is no longer involved.

33:36.607 --> 33:38.741
Consider it done.

33:42.179 --> 33:43.746
Wait a second.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.915
Louis didn't go to Stensland
behind my back.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.651
You send him there
to hedge your bets.

33:48.718 --> 33:52.888
Either Stensland's out
and we double our billings,

33:52.955 --> 33:54.823
or you have plausible
deniability,

33:54.891 --> 33:57.158
and he stays with the firm.

33:57.226 --> 34:01.061
Wow. Am I smart enough
to do that?

34:01.129 --> 34:02.529
If I win, I look great.

34:02.597 --> 34:05.098
If Louis wins, he looks great.

34:05.166 --> 34:08.802
Either way...
you look great.

34:08.870 --> 34:11.472
You mean the firm looks great.

34:11.539 --> 34:13.274
Harvey, what I've been trying
to get into your head

34:13.341 --> 34:15.142
is that you bought in.

34:15.209 --> 34:17.244
You are the firm.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.581
That's it.

34:24.519 --> 34:25.886
Mike, follow me.

34:25.954 --> 34:27.488
I need you
to go talk to Dominic.

34:27.556 --> 34:30.291
What? Why?
Stensland's already CEO.

34:30.359 --> 34:32.460
That won't matter
if we just buy the damn company.

34:32.528 --> 34:36.699
What?

34:36.766 --> 34:41.103
Why are you still working?

34:41.171 --> 34:42.771
It's one of my creations.

34:42.839 --> 34:45.741
I'm not leaving it unfinished.

34:45.808 --> 34:48.110
What the hell do you want?

34:48.177 --> 34:50.211
I'd be happy to tell you
if you put that wrench down.

34:50.279 --> 34:51.345
Yeah, you're quick
with the jokes.

34:51.413 --> 34:53.981
I'm the guy who just got fired.

34:54.049 --> 34:57.251
You're right. I'm sorry.

34:57.318 --> 34:59.253
What would you say
if I told you

34:59.320 --> 35:01.655
we could get your job back
and stick it to Stensland.

35:01.723 --> 35:03.524
I'm done with Harvey
and his plans, yeah?

35:03.592 --> 35:05.125
You were there.
We got fired too.

35:05.193 --> 35:06.594
You and Harvey still have jobs?

35:06.662 --> 35:09.931
He doesn't care
about anybody but himself,

35:09.999 --> 35:11.533
including you, Mike.

35:11.601 --> 35:15.704
Yeah.
You're probably right.

35:15.772 --> 35:19.175
But he did stick his neck out
to keep your company here,

35:19.242 --> 35:22.011
and he does have an idea
that requires your help,

35:22.079 --> 35:25.147
so you can stay here
and call him an asshole,

35:25.215 --> 35:27.549
or you can come with me
and we can help him.

35:31.754 --> 35:34.222
Give me my goddamn shirt.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.041
You know,
it goes from 0 to 60--

35:50.109 --> 35:54.678
In the blink of an eye.

35:54.746 --> 35:57.314
Did you bring me down here
to tell me I can drive this?

35:57.382 --> 35:58.483
Better.

35:58.550 --> 36:01.418
For $250 million,
you can own it.

36:01.486 --> 36:03.554
McKernon Motors is for sale?

36:03.622 --> 36:05.323
If we act fast.

36:05.391 --> 36:06.691
I'll need
to see the financials.

36:06.759 --> 36:08.226
You put together
a letter of intent,

36:08.294 --> 36:09.595
they'll get you the financials.

36:09.663 --> 36:12.465
You know, their real asset
is engine quality.

36:12.533 --> 36:14.100
I don't want
to just buy the name.

36:14.168 --> 36:15.669
Speak of the devil.

36:15.737 --> 36:17.938
Laurence, I'd like you
to meet the man responsible

36:18.006 --> 36:19.673
for every McKernon Motors
engine ever built.

36:19.741 --> 36:21.408
Wow. Dominic Barone.
Very nice to meet you.

36:21.476 --> 36:22.876
Good to meet you.

36:22.944 --> 36:24.745
I'd like to show you something
if you have a minute.

36:24.812 --> 36:27.848
Absolutely.

36:27.915 --> 36:29.916
So how do we get an offer
to the board

36:29.984 --> 36:32.719
before they vote to ratify
the deal tomorrow?

36:32.787 --> 36:34.321
You're gonna
go through those bylaws,

36:34.388 --> 36:35.789
and you're gonna
figure something out.

36:35.857 --> 36:37.624
I don't have to look through
them to figure it out,

36:37.691 --> 36:38.591
because I just did.

36:38.659 --> 36:39.926
Well, what took you so long?

36:39.994 --> 36:42.596
You trying to look like me?

36:47.535 --> 36:49.103
Each of you have 24 hours

36:49.171 --> 36:50.772
to review the documents
in front of you,

36:50.839 --> 36:52.340
so at this time...

36:52.408 --> 36:53.741
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

36:53.809 --> 36:55.977
What is he doing here?

36:56.045 --> 36:57.446
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna take care of this.

36:57.513 --> 36:58.847
No, no, I will.

36:58.915 --> 37:00.982
You gentlemen have no right
to attend this meeting.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.283
Actually, we do.

37:02.351 --> 37:04.785
The bylaw states
that any original employee

37:04.853 --> 37:06.086
has the right
to petition the board

37:06.154 --> 37:07.688
any time they meet.

37:07.756 --> 37:10.357
Dominic Barone
has assigned that right to me.

37:10.424 --> 37:11.925
He was fired.

37:11.992 --> 37:13.459
He no longer has that right.

37:13.527 --> 37:16.029
Per section 17-5, point "C,"

37:16.096 --> 37:17.697
Dominic wasn't given
three days' notice,

37:17.765 --> 37:20.233
so technically he wasn't fired.

37:20.301 --> 37:21.935
Which is why
I do have the right

37:22.003 --> 37:24.038
to urge the board
to accept the offer

37:24.105 --> 37:25.906
for the purchase
of McKernon Motors.

37:25.974 --> 37:28.042
Now, I can tell you
that this offer

37:28.110 --> 37:30.245
will keep manufacturing here
and save jobs

37:30.312 --> 37:32.280
while retaining
the flagship engine

37:32.348 --> 37:33.782
that put this company
on the map,

37:33.850 --> 37:36.151
but I don't have to,
because it happens to be

37:36.219 --> 37:37.720
for way more goddamn money

37:37.787 --> 37:40.922
than the one
in front of you right now.

37:40.990 --> 37:43.558
Hey, Bob.
How are ya?

37:45.727 --> 37:47.395
It's funny
how you held out on me

37:47.462 --> 37:49.096
on that proper
notice exception.

37:49.164 --> 37:50.097
I didn't hold out.

37:50.165 --> 37:51.632
I made that up on the spot.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.167
Really? On the spot?

37:53.235 --> 37:54.702
Remember that
getting it stuff--

37:54.770 --> 37:56.103
I know, right?
I'm getting it.

37:56.171 --> 37:58.639
Well, I was gonna say that,
but now you ruined it.

37:58.706 --> 38:01.308
That's one thing
you definitely get.

38:01.376 --> 38:04.011
How to ruin it.

38:04.079 --> 38:05.312
How to ruin it?

38:05.380 --> 38:08.749
I heard that.

38:20.029 --> 38:22.664
I have to admit,
you don't suck.

38:22.732 --> 38:24.934
I wish I could say
the same for you.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.240
Time to pay the Piper.

38:30.307 --> 38:31.875
Just so you know,
I took the liberty

38:31.943 --> 38:34.445
of ordering some
really expensive wines.

38:34.512 --> 38:36.080
Hope that's okay.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.594
Sorry, sir, but the check's
been paid for in full

38:49.662 --> 38:51.496
by a Harvey Specter.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.268
There, uh, might have been
some gluten in the ravioli.

39:04.942 --> 39:07.343
I hear McKernon Motors
is getting a new owner.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.144
We're not only
handling the sale,

39:09.212 --> 39:11.379
but with the expansion plan
they're putting in place,

39:11.447 --> 39:12.748
our billables should double.

39:12.815 --> 39:14.316
Nicely done.

39:14.383 --> 39:17.585
I did it for the firm.

39:21.523 --> 39:25.660
♪ ♪

39:25.728 --> 39:30.596

to turn away and run ♪

39:44.549 --> 39:49.086
What are you doing here?

39:49.154 --> 39:50.488
You were right.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.923
I should never
have kept it from you

39:51.991 --> 39:55.461
that Trevor was dealing
all that time.

39:55.528 --> 40:00.499
Well, I mean, it's, uh...

40:00.567 --> 40:04.036
it's all in the past, right?

40:04.104 --> 40:06.739
No.

40:06.807 --> 40:10.409
What are you talking about?

40:10.476 --> 40:15.914
He's lying to you.

40:15.982 --> 40:17.949
He's still dealing.

40:18.017 --> 40:20.285
And I'm done with him.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.594
Son of a bitch.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.465
Well, thank you, uh,
for telling me.

40:35.533 --> 40:39.503
No, don't. Stop.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.472
We're even.

40:41.540 --> 40:45.876
And that is the last time
I am ever ratting on anyone.

40:45.944 --> 40:50.448
So if you fall for it again...

40:50.515 --> 40:53.618
it's on you.

40:53.686 --> 40:57.889
Are you angry with me?

40:57.957 --> 40:59.658
You told me
he would listen to me.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.860
- I thought he would.
- Well, he didn't.

41:01.928 --> 41:03.696
I...

41:03.764 --> 41:06.199
I'm sorry.

41:06.267 --> 41:08.668
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

41:16.478 --> 41:17.545
No, I can't.

41:17.612 --> 41:18.679
I can't.

41:18.747 --> 41:19.780
What?

41:19.848 --> 41:23.350
No, I-- I fought with him.

41:23.417 --> 41:25.285
Oh, God.

41:25.352 --> 41:28.788
This is too much.

41:28.855 --> 41:30.156
Oh, my God.
